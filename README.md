# **About**

Iran has been long facing critical air pollution rates as a result of poor management resulting in the depletion of ecosystems. Lack of monitoring infrastructure has led to discrepancies, [IQAir](https://www.iqair.com/iran) a renowned air pollution service is only fed data from two monitoring sights in Iran's capital, Tehran. Providing an accessible and affordable system to monitor emissions is required, providing trust-worthy insights. Nafas is an open-source project tailored at providing a distributed system built on pre-existing and cheap components.
